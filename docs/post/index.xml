      <description>The Chicago Monuments Committee recently met for the first time. Their agenda is to examine monuments for &amp;ldquo;white supremacy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;connections to racist acts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;creating tension between people&amp;rdquo;. They have identified &amp;ldquo;problematic&amp;rdquo; monuments, include statues of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant, for removal.
Mayor Lightfoot formed the committee and will likely follow its recommendations. She has already removed statues of Christopher Columbus.
If the Democrats are renaming monuments and parks, why is it that Bauler Park is not on their list?</description>
