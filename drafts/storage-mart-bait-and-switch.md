Storage Mart gets you in at market rate, but then raises the cost 8% per year.
Soon, you're paying far more than market rate.

They rely on the fact that it is inconvenient to move all your stuff.

This is bait-and-switch. (Maybe). What is is?

And again, they use inconvenience to steal more money:

Feb 9, 2021
During a recent review of all customer files, it was discovered that your unit did not have the required coverage documentation for your stored goods. In your StorageMart rental agreement, we require that customers have proof of insurance or opt-in to our Value Coverage program.

They're lying. I provided renter's insurance a long time ago.

Then -- get this -- they automatically add the charge to the bill:

While not an insurance policy, the Value Coverage program is a convenient way to satisfy this provision.

To help you correct this issue as easily as possible, we have added $1,500 in Value Coverage to your account starting February 7, 2021. Value Coverage for the remainder of February is free, and no additional payment is required at this time.

If you’d like to opt-out of Value Coverage, simply provide us with proof of insurance from a third-party provider, and we’ll be happy to cancel your participation. If you’d like to keep Value Coverage, no action is required from you.

Effective March 1, 2021 the regular monthly rate of $10.97 plus any applicable tax will be applied to your account and will automatically renew for as long as you occupy the storage unit or until you opt-out of the plan.

Unless you opt out. Nice.

Ok, fine, StorageMart, I opt out. Except -- the email you sent was from <no-reply@email.storage-mart.com>. And there is no contact info at all on 
the email.

In fact, I have no emails from you, ever, that weren't no-reply.

So, let's go to the website. 

No "Contact Us"

"Need Help?" link isn't actually a link. (Update: a phone number appears next to it, but only on Chrome)

"About Us" has no contact info.

So all you can do is contact the local store. I go to the store page on the site, but again, no email and no contact form. All there is is a phone number.

So I call. And there is no answer. "Leave a message!" says a cheery voice.


There's a well-known funnel of people dropping out at each level of inconveniece. At each level, a certain number of people will
decide it's not worth their time. For each person, that means 10.97/month, 131.64/per year, indefinitely. If a standard 10x10 storage
unit goes for $100/month, StorageMart has increased its revenues by 11% for each customer it wears out. 

This is not peanuts. It's a deliberate, and very lucrative, business strategy. 

Google "increase switching costs". One of the things that MBAs do.

Not unlike the parking lot operator scam in Chicago. The sign says $8 (and in tiny print, for the first 30 minutes). This is a lawyer lie.

Finally got them on the phone. "Oh yeah, it looks like it expired. They go through the system every once in a while and do that."

"Uh, it doesn't expire. It's say insurance that I've been paying for 20 years now. Same policy"

"It says it expired."

He's probably not lying. He's just a clerk, and the computer in front of him probably does say "expired". But it's a Storage Mart lie.

So I had to ask the wife to find the policy, because she set it up. She's busy, and it took her a few days to find it.
She didn't have it, and had to call State Farm to get it. Then I had to scan
it, and transfer the scan using a USB stick to my computer, and then email it. 

Of course, the USB stick didn't work on my Mac. At all. No amount of Googling fixed the problem. So I had to take a picture with my phone, then transfer it to Google drive, then drag it into an email,

Is this all Storage Mart's problem? You bet it is. They know full well that it is inconvenient to find and supply paperwork.

How much of our time did this take, collectively? Including calls, talking about it, maybe 2, or 3 hours? Including my time, my wife's, and State Farms?

This is a large cost, and Storage Mart doesn't care, because they don't pay it.

Dark patterns.
